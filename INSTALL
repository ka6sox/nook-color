Welcome to an early version of optware for android

To install requires a functional root shell on your device.  Simply
put the optware-bootstrap.shar into somewhere writeable like /data
and run it with  "sh optware-bootstrap.shar"

Example:

adb push optware-bootstrap.shar /data
adb shell

# sh /data/optware-bootstrap.shar

When done, reboot and verify you can run /opt/bin/bash for instance.


NOTE:  

The default adb shell is not great for running optware.  You
could manually run  /opt/bin/bash  and source /etc/profile but
an easier way is just to ssh in with your newly created user.

Since dropbear does not yet autostart on boot, start it with:

/opt/sbin/dropbear

Then ssh to your device's IP address. You may want to prevent
your device from sleeping or keep a running ping to google.com or 
similar to keep the connection alive for your ssh session.

Easier local options are forthcoming.


IF UPGRADING

For now if you have an earlier version of optware already installed
it is recommended to start clean.  Currently the installer will skip
creating /data/opt if it exists.  This is a good idea, but unfortunately
important files introduced in this version will also not get copied.

This bug will be corrected but for now, please rename /data/opt 
to /data/opt.old or similar before starting and reboot to clear links
or mounts in the root filesystem
